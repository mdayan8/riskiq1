## 🚀 The Core Intelligence Layer

RiskIQ is built on the **Astra Swarm Architecture**—a specialized multi-agent system where autonomous units collaborate in parallel to deliver 100% grounded results.

### 🤖 The Astra Swarm
- **Nexus Core**: High-level system orchestration and task routing.
- **Omni-Extract**: Neural parsing engine for deep document structure extraction.
- **Astra-Compliance**: Regulatory alignment unit mapped against GVR standards.
- **Sentinel-Risk**: Inference-based fraud detection and probability scoring.
- **Lexis-Report**: High-fidelity serialization and PDF executive reporting.
- **Atlas-Vault**: Multi-layer persistent data architecture.

## 💎 Premium Design Philosophy

RiskIQ features an **Authoritative Command Interface** designed to minimize cognitive load while maximizing decision-making clarity.

- **Intelligence Vault**: A high-fidelity grid system for browsing AI-scrutinized sessions.
- **Decision Engineering Charts**: Wide-aspect telemetry charts for deep-dive risk analysis.
- **Grounded Evidence Layer**: Full citation mapping that anchors AI insights to high-fidelity document snippets.
- **Executive Reporting**: Resilient, fail-safe PDF generation with deterministic data fallbacks.

## 🛠️ Technical Intelligence Stack

### **Frontend Resilience**
- **Architecture**: React + Vite (ESM)
- **Styling**: Tailored Tailwind CSS for glassmorphism and depth.
- **Data Viz**: Recharts for wide-aspect temporal analytics.
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent semantic iconography.

### **Backend Orchestration**
- **Runtime**: Node.js (High-concurrency logic).
- **Inference Engine**: DeepSeek + RandomForest dual-layer verification.
- **Persistence**: Hybrid PostgreSQL (Relational/Telemetry) + MongoDB (Schema-less Extraction).
- **Communication**: RESTful API with Zod-validated state management.
